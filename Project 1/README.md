## What is it
**ESCAPE_404** is a narrative ASCII game focused on learning programming, real-world consequences, and performance-based progression.

The player does not choose endings from menus — the system decides based on actions, acquired knowledge, and decisions made throughout the journey.

## About the Game [+..••]
- You wake up in a broken system.
  - Nothing is explained.
  - Nothing is guaranteed.

- To escape, you need to understand the system, not just survive in it.
- The game mixes:
  - ASCII exploration
  - Environmental narrative
  - Educational challenges
  - Permanent consequences

Every decision shapes the world, the NPCs, and the ending.

## Main Concepts < / >
- **Emergent narrative:** the story unfolds through the environment and the world's reactions.
- **Integrated learning:** programming challenges are part of the mechanics, not interruptions.
- **Real consequences:** choices affect maps, dialogues, access, and endings.
- **Multiple endings:** automatically determined by player performance.
- **No traditional HUD:** the entire interface is ASCII.

## Structure of the World .ೃ࿔ ✈︎ *:･
1. **Initial Forest —** Movement and Survival Tutorial
2. **Camp Hub —** Central Area with Multiple Educational Paths
3. **Thematic Areas:**
    - Algorithms
    - Conditional Statements
    - Loops
    - Functions
    - Debugging and Error Handling
4. **Final escape zone —** unlocked only after real progress.

## Dynamic NPCs ✮⋆˙
- The **professor** reacts to:
  - Accumulated XP
  - Narrative choices
  - Overall progress

- **Dialogues** change according to:
  - Game chapter
  - Past decisions
  - Player performance

NPCs are not static: they **evaluate you**.

## Chapter System ⊹˚.
The game is divided into global chapters:
- **Chapter 1 —** Lost
- **Chapter 2 —** Camp
- **Chapter 3 —** Escape

The same map can change depending on the chapter:
- New access points
- NPCs disappear
- Areas are blocked or unlocked

## Multiple Finals ৎ˖ִ ˚
The ending is automatically determined based on:
- Total XP
- Narrative flags
- Critical decisions

Ending types:
- Good Ending
- Neutral Ending
- Bad Ending
- Betrayal Ending

There is no direct choice of ending.

## Technologies Used ⏻

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- ASCII Art
- Local State Management

    - No frameworks.
    - No engines.
    - Everything built from scratch.
