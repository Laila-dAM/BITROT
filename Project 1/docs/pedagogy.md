# Pedagogy

## Educational Goal

Teach programming concepts in a way that reduces fear, encourages curiosity, and builds confidence through practice.

The game treats learning as a process, not a test.

## Core Pedagogical Principle

"The best master is an eternal learner."

Learning is never complete. Previously learned concepts return naturally during progression.

## Target Learners

* Complete beginners
* Students with little confidence in programming
* Curious players with no formal background

No prior technical knowledge is required.

## Learning Philosophy

* Learning happens by doing
* Errors are normal and expected
* Repetition reinforces understanding
* Curiosity is a positive signal

The player is never punished for trying.

## What Counts as "Learned"

A concept is considered learned when the player:

* Uses it correctly multiple times
* Applies it in different contexts
* Combines it with older concepts

There are no formal exams.

## Curriculum Structure

### Beginner Level

Focus: basic understanding and confidence

* Computers and systems
* Files and folders
* Basic commands
* Input and output
* Simple logic

### Intermediate Level

Focus: reasoning and structure

* Variables and states
* Conditions (if / else)
* Loops
* Functions
* Debugging

### Advanced Level

Focus: system thinking

* Data organization
* Simple databases
* Scripts and automation
* Backend concepts
* Security basics

## Reinforcement System

Previously learned concepts return automatically:

* Inside new challenges
* As secondary requirements
* In optional reinforcement missions

The player revisits knowledge without feeling tested.

## Difficulty Detection

The game observes player behavior:

* Number of errors
* Time spent per challenge
* Hint usage

Based on this, the system can:

* Simplify challenges
* Offer extra practice
* Reduce pressure

## Error Handling as Teaching

Errors are teaching moments:

* First errors give gentle hints
* Repeated errors give clearer guidance
* Feedback focuses on improvement, not failure

Error messages are supportive and short.

## Anti-Cramming Design

* No memorization-based tasks
* Solutions must be understood, not copied
* Copy/paste detection resets the module

The goal is understanding, not speed.

## Learning Pace

* Players progress at their own speed
* No time limits for learning
* Long breaks reset progress gently

Returning players relearn core concepts naturally.

## Assessment Method

Assessment is implicit:

* Progress through areas
* Ability to combine concepts
* Reduced need for hints

There are no scores that label the player.

## Accessibility and Comfort

* Clear language
* Minimal text per screen
* Calm feedback
* No shaming language

The game is designed to feel safe.

## Educational Success Criteria

The pedagogy is successful if:

* Players feel less afraid of programming
* Players understand basic concepts by practice
* Players believe they can keep learning

## Pedagogical Rule

If a teaching element increases fear or shame, it does not belong in the game.
