# Vision

## Project Name

Interactive Programming Learning Platform (ASCII Game)

## One-Sentence Vision

An educational ASCII web game where learning programming physically and emotionally organizes the world, and mistakes never mean failure as a person.

## Core Emotion

"The world didn’t break when I made a mistake."

## Purpose

Teach programming concepts through practice, humor, and narrative, making players feel capable, curious, and safe to fail.

## What This Project Is

* A web-based, full-stack, ASCII game
* Educational, but playful and strange
* Narrative-driven, but system-focused
* Designed to be finished (MVP-first)

## What This Project Is NOT

* Not a traditional course
* Not a serious simulator
* Not a visual-heavy game
* Not a joke about the player

## Core Rule (Never Explain This In-Game)

Learning is treated as a physical and emotional act, not just an intellectual one.

When the player learns:

* The ASCII world becomes more stable
* Glitches reduce
* The environment feels calmer

## Tone & Humor

* Weird and slightly dark, but never cruel
* Meta-humor (the game knows it is a game)
* The system and professor are targets of humor, never the player

## Narrative Pillars

* A morally ambiguous professor
* A terminal with simple emotions
* A world that reacts to learning
* Secret logs for players who explore

## Player Promise

* You are allowed to fail
* Errors give feedback, not shame
* Curiosity is rewarded, not punished

## MVP Focus

* One hub (the camp)
* Three main areas
* One ending: escape through knowledge
* 15–20 challenges

Everything else is an expansion.

## Success Definition

The project is successful if:

* A beginner understands basic programming concepts
* The player feels less afraid of making mistakes
* The game can be finished and presented as a portfolio project

## Guiding Question (For Every Decision)

Does this help the player feel more capable, not more stupid?

If the answer is no, it does not belong in the game.
