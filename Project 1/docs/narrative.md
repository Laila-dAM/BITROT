# Narrative

## Narrative Purpose

Support learning through mood, humor, and mystery without interrupting gameplay.

The story exists to make the player feel curious, safe, and engaged, not to explain everything.

## Core Narrative Theme

Learning is freedom.

Knowledge is the only way out.

## Setting

A strange digital forest connected to a technological camp.

The world looks unstable at first. As the player learns, the environment becomes more organized and calm.

## Story Premise

The player wakes up in a digital forest.
A terminal blinks.
A professor appears.

The professor explains, calmly and casually, that the player cannot leave until they learn programming.

The situation is treated as normal by the world.

## Main Characters

### The Player

* Silent protagonist
* Represented only by ASCII
* Emotions shown through visual states
* Learns by interacting with systems

### The Professor

* Highly intelligent
* Morally ambiguous
* Sarcastic but encouraging
* Treats the camp as necessary training

The professor believes learning justifies everything.

### The Terminal

* A system with simple emotions
* Tries to help, sometimes incorrectly
* Never judges the player
* Acts as emotional support

## Narrative Tone

* Weird and slightly dark
* Calm, not scary
* Meta-aware (the game knows it is a game)
* Humor targets the system, not the player

## Story Delivery

The story is told through:

* Short dialogues
* Environmental changes
* System messages
* Optional secret logs

There are no long explanations.

## Secret Logs (Optional Lore)

Stored in a hidden folder (.logs/).

Rules:

* Do not help gameplay
* Short sentences
* No conclusions
* Optional to read

Logs create deeper meaning for curious players.

## Player Choice and Meaning

Player choices do not change the ending, but they change interpretation:

* Questioning the professor reveals more dialogue
* Exploring reveals more logs
* Obedience speeds up progress

## Silence as Narrative

Silence is used intentionally:

* After major errors
* During system glitches
* When the professor has no answer

Silence creates emotional weight.

## Memory and Recognition

The game remembers patterns:

* Repeated mistakes
* Curiosity behaviors
* Escape attempts

Characters may reference past actions.

## The Ending

There is only one ending.

The professor prepares the final task.
The player uses only learned knowledge.
There is no exit button.

The player escapes by understanding the system.

## Final Message

The game never says it directly, but leaves the feeling:

"You were never broken. You were just learning."

## Narrative Rule

If a story element explains too much, it must be removed.
