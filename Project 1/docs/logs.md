# Secret Logs

## Purpose

Secret logs exist to add depth, mystery, and emotional weight to the game.

They are optional and never required to finish the game.

Players who read them feel like accomplices, not heroes.

## Core Rule

Secret logs must never help gameplay.

They do not give hints, solutions, or advantages.

## Location

Logs are stored in a hidden folder:

/.logs/

They only appear if the player explores or uses curiosity-driven commands.

## Writing Rules

* Short sentences
* No explanations
* No conclusions
* No direct teaching
* Minimal context

The player connects the meaning alone.

## Tone

* Quiet
* Uncomfortable
* Reflective
* Never dramatic

Logs should feel like fragments, not stories.

## Types of Logs

### Recruit Logs

Show that other players existed before.

Themes:

* Giving up
* Learning too fast
* Almost escaping
* Staying by choice

### Professor Logs

Private thoughts of the professor.

Themes:

* Doubt
* Fear of being unnecessary
* Justifying actions

### System Logs

Cold and mechanical.

Themes:

* Curiosity as risk
* Learning as instability
* Emotion detected as error

### Escape Attempts

Records of failed escapes.

Themes:

* Correct logic
* Wrong timing
* Knowledge without readiness

### Player Shadow Logs

Meta-observation of the current player.

Themes:

* Repetition
* Persistence
* Hesitation

```

but they keep typing
```

## Frequency

* Logs are rare
* Never more than one per area
* Some players may never find any

## Narrative Function

Logs create:

* Meta-narrative
* Adult layer of reading
* Emotional contrast to gameplay

They deepen the story without interrupting learning.

## Design Rule

If a log explains itself, it must be deleted.
